# Manga Tracker Bot

## Problem

As a manga-reader myself, I often faced with issue of not sure when will the manga be released and sometimes I would read manga that are not listed on platforms such as MangaDEX, and also often manga that are listed on MangaDEX, does not have english translation. Hence I will have to turn to individual sites specifically for the manga. Hence the list is quite long over time, and I will tend to lose the URL that I am tracking. This bots aims to consistently track whether are there latest releases by calling a GET call onto the registered URL and checks whether is it available, and sends a notification to the users that which manga is available through a daily cron job checking.
